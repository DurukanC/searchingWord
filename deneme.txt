Jupiter is a gas giant which means that the planet does not have a solid surface, the planet is mostly made up of swirling gases and liquids. Jupiter has eighty moons, and fifty-seven of them are officially named while the other twenty-three are waiting to be named. The reason why Jupiter has so many moons is that it is extremely large. Jupiter is more than twice as massive as all the planets in the solar system combined. Dozens of satellites revolve around Jupiter because of its strong gravitational pull caused by its massiveness. It pulls lots of asteroids and space stuff which turn into moons.
